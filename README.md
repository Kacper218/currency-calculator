# currency-calculator

This is my second project that I'm currently working on to pratice my skills in frontweb development.

I'm using VS Code editor with VIM extension.

I just started so it's pretty simple so far, but im trying to do my best.

The calculator currently has two currencies which additionally change the theme.

Second currency is actually a joke related to the game Gothic I.

Website is in polish language.
